Introduction
A unicorn company has its humble beginnings as a startup company with a low valuation. As these startups grow and expand and reach a valuation of $1 billion, then these companies are categorized as a unicorn company. Furthermore, these unicorn companies are not listed in the stock market and makes it more fascinating how these startups reach such great heights of reaching a valuation of $ 1 billion. Apart from having a high valuation, what factors does a startup require to have the title ‘unicorn company’. To answer what takes to make it as a unicorn company, we need to understand the journey of a unicorn company and the type of industry it operates in.

From the inception of the first unicorn company, from the year 2005 to 2015 the number of unicorn companies were booming at a rapid rate.
